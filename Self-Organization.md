## Life as an Expat
Living as an expat in Korea for three years has taught me many things, especially, that it is always better to be self-reliant and prepared for worse case scenarios. Although it is not possible for us to factor all the parameters of *life*, it is still better to be as informed as possible, from as many types of sources as possible (mainly to avoid echo-chambers and prejudice). So, I am using this space to provide a list of things that were/are useful for me, and hopefully it might be useful to others.

So far I can think of three distinct ways I can categorise the information: Visa/Administrative Processes, Personal Space Management, and Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).

### Visa/Administrative Processes
For details of Korean Visa categories, check out the [offcial website](https://www.visa.go.kr/main/openMain.do).
Here, the detailed list of document are listed for different categories (e.g. E3 for Postdocs, D-2 for students etc.). The information here is the most accurate and often might save one a lot of time when the local administration (e.g. Uni, local immigration office) is unclear about the rules. 

One tip, for postdoc applicants, who are yet to obtain their PhD certificate, __ONE CAN GET E-3 VISA WITHOUT PHD DEGREE__, as the requirement is __Masters' and 3 years of Research Experience__.

### Personal Space Management

#### List of Youtube and blog links which provide good, practical suggestions that can be applied to organize a small place

### Personal Knowledge Management
For, reference management, I have been using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) for the last year and it is absoultely __brilliant!__
The fact that it is cross-platform and has a free plan as well, makes it even better. 
The syncing across devises had been wokring nicely as well. 

For note taking, I would strongly recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), as it is basically in __Markdown__ format, provides knowledge __network graphs__, and includes __mind-map__ or [canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas).
