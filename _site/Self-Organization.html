    <h2 id="life-as-an-expat">Life as an Expat</h2>
<p>Living as an expat in Korea for three years has taught me many things, especially, that it is always better to be self-reliant and prepared for worse case scenarios. Although it is not possible for us to factor all the parameters of <em>life</em>, it is still better to be as informed as possible, from as many types of sources as possible (mainly to avoid eco-chambers and prejudice). So, I am using this space to provide a list of things that were/are useful for me, and hopefully it might be useful to others.</p>

<p>So far I can think of three distinct ways I can categorise the information: Visa/Administrative Processes, Personal Space Management, and Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).</p>

<h3 id="visaadministrative-processes">Visa/Administrative Processes</h3>
<p>For details of Korean Visa categories, check out the <a href="https://www.visa.go.kr/main/openMain.do">offcial website</a>.
Here, the detailed list of document are listed for different categories (e.g. E3 for Postdocs, D-2 for students etc.). The information here is the most accurate and often might save one a lot of time when the local administration (e.g. Uni, local immigration office) is unclear about the rules.</p>

<p>One tip, for postdoc applicants, who are yet to obtain their PhD certificate, <strong>ONE CAN GET E-3 VISA WITHOUT PHD DEGREE</strong>, as the requirement is <strong>Mastersâ€™ and 3 years of Research Experience</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="personal-knowledge-management">Personal Knowledge Management</h3>
<p>For, reference management, I have been using <a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a> for the last year and it is absoultely <strong>brilliant!</strong>
The fact that it is cross-platform and has a free plan as well, makes it even better. 
The syncing across devises had been wokring nicely as well.</p>

<p>For note taking, I would strongly recommend <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, as it is basically in <strong>Markdown</strong> format, provides knowledge <strong>network graphs</strong>, and includes <strong>mind-map</strong> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/canvas">canvas</a>.</p>
