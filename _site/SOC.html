The dynamics of the system, itself, guides it from a disordered state to an ordered state.</h4>

<p>Abundantly seen in nature, and often found in many astrophysical systems. However, the SOC can be studied using toy-models and simple dynamical simulations on structured lattice. My Master’s projects were on the study of SOC for various systems, ranging from <em>2D sandpile model</em>, <em>Eulerian Walkers</em>, to <em>Brownian Ratchet</em>.</p>

<p>Although, I do not work on these anymore, it turned out to be steady stepping stone in getting into numerical simulations. Some of the old slides and reports are included for anyone interested.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Here’s the link to my first project from the <del>Summer of ‘69</del> summer of 2013, on the <a href="Ayan_Bhattacharjee_Summer_Project_Presentation_2013.pdf">Self-Organized Criticality and Extreme Events</a>.</li>
  <li>Another interesting system was that of an Eulerian Walker, often used in <em>Rotor-Router</em> and <em>Electrical Circuits</em> in optimizing efficiency. My focus was on the <a href="Ayan_Bhattacharjee_Seminar_Course_Presentation_2014.pdf">Dynamics of Eulerian Walkers on 2D lattice</a>.</li>
  <li>My final project, and the most detailed work on this, was done on <a href="Ayan_Bhattacharjee_Parrondos_Paradox_Presentation_2014.pdf">Parrondo’s Paradox and the Brownian Ratchet</a>, where both numerical and analytical studies were carried out on the topic. A detailed report can also be found <a href="Ayan_Bhattacharjee_Parrondos_Paradox_Report_2014.pdf">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The takeaway message is small scale dynamics can lead to large scale effects and <del>not to ask Ayan any hard questions on these as these are decade old stuff</del> such phenomena can provide valuable insight into more complex real world systems.</p>
