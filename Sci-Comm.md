#### "Experience is the name everyone gives to his mistakes."
-- Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan (1892)

So, here lies the collection of different _experiences_ that I have had, which were ~~unfortunately~~ recorded.

#### "If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties."
—- Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning (1605)

And precisely for this reason, we have to keep questioning the assumption, of others' and of our own. But how do we do so, without our own biases coming in the way?

#### “It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.”
-- George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), Middlemarch (1871-1872)

The only way out is communicating what we think, what we believe and be open to the entire experience of the discussion that follows, without a single objective of pursuing the truth.

Here's the link to my recent seminar on the [Origin of Jets around Neutron Stars](https://youtu.be/y_XMcYJ5dL4).
